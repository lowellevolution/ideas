Overview
--------

We propose that the Human Relations department introduce a new benefit by providing access to free or subsidized language training courses to all city employees.

Existing Problem
----------------

As a city that is home to many new arrivals and immigrant communities, the City of Lowell can struggle to effectively communicate with existing residents and new arrivals who are not proficient in English as their primary language. An estimated 43.5% of the population speaks a non-English language. The predominant non-English languages spoken in Lowell ([source: Census Bureau 2016 American Community Service 5 year estimate](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) are Spanish (14.3%), Khmer (12%), and Portugese (4.6%). This can present problems in the communication and interaction between city services and low-English residents.

Proposed Solution
-----------------

While we believe the city should prioritize multilingual proficiency in its hiring guidelines, we also believe that there is a larger opportunity: offering language training to existing employees as an employee benefit. This policy should have two main pillars:

1.  Add new employee benefit of free or subsidized language training for all city employees.
    
2.  Formally recognize language proficiency in HR guidelines and union negoations for hiring decisions, promotions, and compensation evaluation.
    

We believe that even if only a small percentage of city employees follow through on this program to a point of language proficiency, the city will greatly benefit from a distributed group of employees who are able to converse with low-English residents in their native language. In turn, employees will personally benefit from improving their skillset, helping to foster a positive work culture and increasing perceptions of the city being a great workplace.

We also believe that increasing language capabilities will be particularly beneficial in these areas:

1.  Police department. More bilingual/multilingual officers would be an enormous boon to the city for two main reasons: first, by improving efficient and accurate communication in a crisis situation; and second, by improving trust in the community by showing effort by officers to meet low-English residents in their native language.
    
2.  First Responders. The fire and police departments often run into communication barriers in emergency response situations where every second counts. Increased multilingual ability among first responders will lead to increased speed, accuracy, and success in emergency response.
    
3.  School department. For many new arrivals, schools are the first and most important interaction with the city. Improving communication lines between teachers/admin/staff and students and familes would reap immediate benefits and help children thrive. The central office would also benefit, particularly around student registration and transportation communications between parents and staff.
    
4.  City admininistraion. While many official city communications will still require translation by a fluent translator, increasing language ability at the employee level will go a long way towards improving communication and interaction with city departments. Many low-English residents find themselves confused by interactions with the city regarding taxes, parking tickets, permitting, etc.
    

Master Plan Impact
------------------

**Executes Master Plan Objective** “Sustained Public Engagement” is a key pillar of the Master Plan, and this policy would directly address the stated objective to “Identify barriers to community participation and develop strategies to eliminate them”. This policy would strengthen the Master Plan.
